# es6playground

This project contains simple examples to demonstrate ES6 features.

You should review the [ECMAScript 6 compatibility chart]
(https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) to see which ES6 features 
are supported in various browsers, servers, mobile platforms and 
polyfills.

To enable different ES6 feature examples, uncomment a line in `js/base.js`
